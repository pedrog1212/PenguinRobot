# PenguinRobot
Penguin robot can follow an object, carry small objects, and follow a dark line.

The Penguin robot is just one more inspirational step to guide future generations into STEM.
During the time they are playing and putting all the parts together 
to make the Penguin move as they imagine- their minds are growing, solving difficulties,
and stretching patience, which will make their minds get more used to future challenges. 
Penguin brings the difficulties of carefully putting parts together for the prize of seeing their own assembly work,
combined with the traditional foam building toys that they have used since early childhood for celebrations and fun. 

Penguins can follow an object, carry small objects, and follow a dark line.
It weighs 6lb and the basic structure is two plastic PLA 3D printed boards 
dovetailed to attach the electronics and motors.

On the top of the electronics base is an assembled body 
that hides the electronics and carries small objects. 
Penguin parts fit in a 6x6x6 inch box and the assembling time is 2 hours.

Penguin is using a cell phone as remote control,
with the Bluetooth application "ELEGOO BLE Tool".

2. Install the phone application "ELEGOO BLE Tool". 
3. Read the instructions about how this phone app is customized. 
4. Put in the customized menu the following messages:
5.  'a' to activate the following Line option
6.  'c' following an object 
7.  'd' state changing
8.  'o' avoiding obstacles  // *** used this Penguin robot option without the foam chassis
